# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 2020-03-11

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed how shell scripts work.

**Thoughts**: I started over the challenge again to distract myself. It will take another 1~2 hrs to finish the homework. I also found a good reference book: Learning the bash Shell, 3rd Edition by Cameron Newham

**Link(s) to work**: [The bash post](https://www.owlfox.org/blog/bash_101/)
