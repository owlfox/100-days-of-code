# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: 2020-03-11

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed how shell scripts work.

**Thoughts**: I started over the challenge again to distract myself. It will take another 1~2 hrs to finish the homework. I also found a good reference book: Learning the bash Shell, 3rd Edition by Cameron Newham
